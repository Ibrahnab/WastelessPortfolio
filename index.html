					<p class="white">Wasteless is a simple way for busy young adults to plan their meals,
						 keep track of their ingredients and waste less food. With spirit,
						  Wasteless generates a wasteless meal plan based on the users' 
						  available ingredients. Wasteless contains a wide selection of recipes, 
						  ready in 60 min or less than 60 min. With the recipe directions and 
						  ingredients at glance, no more endlessly scrolling to look at how many 
						  of the ingredients you need.

						<h3 class=dark>WHY</h3>
						<p class="dark">Students are very busy and occasionally eat alone.
							This comes with the issue that they have to choose what to eat every day 
							and it is often the case that they have left over ingredients that just
							 expire in the fridge. Food and health are always the topics when it comes
							  to the fundamental needs of people in everyday life. It’s difficult to get 
							  a balance between food storing and consumption. One scenario is that one bought
							   some foods from groceries, kept them in the refrigerator, then forgot the 
							   existence of some of them. When they found them and realized afterwards,
								the food had already passed the expiration date and had to end up in the
								 garbage eventually, which is not only unsustainable but also a waste of money.

						<h3 class=dark >WHAT</h3>
						<p class="dark">We want to make it easier for people to use all of their food before it goes bad and to provide easy, delicious, quick and cheap recipes that they can plan ahead for the week to prevent food waste.

							Students usually have a pretty hectic schedule on their hands and deciding on what to cook for the day or the entire week can be time consuming. To support this,  an application could be developed that keeps track of what ingredients the user has in their fridge. And make decisions/recommendations on what types of meals can be produced with the available ingredients. 
							
							For this project we are going to focus on making a website that helps students plan their meals to prevent unnecessary food-waste. Further, the application will hopefully make it easier to plan what meals to cook for the week based on the available ingredients.
