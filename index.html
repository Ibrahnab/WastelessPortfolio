					<h3 class="white">About Wasteless</h3>
					<p class="white">Wasteless is a simple way for busy young adults to plan their meals,
						 keep track of their ingredients and waste less food. With spirit,
						  Wasteless generates a wasteless meal plan based on the users' 
						  available ingredients. Wasteless contains a wide selection of recipes, 
						  ready in 60 min or less than 60 min. With the recipe directions and 
						  ingredients at glance, no more endlessly scrolling to look at how many 
						  of the ingredients you need.

						<h3 class=dark>WHY</h3>
						<p class="dark">Students are very busy and occasionally eat alone.
							This comes with the issue that they have to choose what to eat every day 
							and it is often the case that they have left over ingredients that just
							 expire in the fridge. Food and health are always the topics when it comes
							  to the fundamental needs of people in everyday life. It’s difficult to get 
							  a balance between food storing and consumption. One scenario is that one bought
							   some foods from groceries, kept them in the refrigerator, then forgot the 
							   existence of some of them. When they found them and realized afterwards,
								the food had already passed the expiration date and had to end up in the
								 garbage eventually, which is not only unsustainable but also a waste of money.
					   </p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm">
					<div class="textcard" id="offsetcard">
						<h3 class=dark >WHAT</h3>
						<p class="dark">We want to make it easier for people to use all of their food before it goes bad and to provide easy, delicious, quick and cheap recipes that they can plan ahead for the week to prevent food waste.

							Students usually have a pretty hectic schedule on their hands and deciding on what to cook for the day or the entire week can be time consuming. To support this,  an application could be developed that keeps track of what ingredients the user has in their fridge. And make decisions/recommendations on what types of meals can be produced with the available ingredients. 
							
							For this project we are going to focus on making a website that helps students plan their meals to prevent unnecessary food-waste. Further, the application will hopefully make it easier to plan what meals to cook for the week based on the available ingredients.

							 is shown under the recipe name indicating when it’s about to expire. Additionaly

							The user can add items to their ingredients list by navigating to the “check my ingredients tab”. 
							Similarly, health bars are shown indicating when the item is about to expire. And also showing nutrients 
							in the ingredients per 100 grams

							This direction therefore allows the user to set up a meal plan for the

						<div>
							<p class="lastp">“The final prototype has to help doing your part in reducing greenhouse gasses by reducing food waste”</p>
						</div>
						
					</div>
					<p class="white reflection">The main feature we developed focuses on creating wasteless
						 meal plans with smooth and intuitive interactions. As our aim was to 
						 create a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and our target group wanted an 
						 easy way to choose recipes and reduce waste at the same time, we decided
						  to keep the interaction and features simple. Using a human-centered approach
						   we used our initial user study to empathize with our user group. Based on 
						   these we created a persona, Olivia, who represents the target group and helps
						    us imagine how she would use our application. Paired with our own experiences 
							in the kitchen, we created, to the best of our ability, an application that 
							tethers to the needs of our target group.In our process, there are several features
							 we considered adding but eventually decided not to implement including but not
							  limited to having the ability to insert an URL of your own favourite recipes 
							  one found online, adding additional ingredients besides the required ingredients
							   for the recipes, a timer, a feature that specifies how to store food properly 
							   and a separate feature that suggests what to do with leftover ingredients.
							   The reason why most of these features weren’t implemented is due to 
							   either that the feature defies our original purpose of reducing food 
							   waste or falls outside of our MVP scope.

						For future work, the application needs to be evaluated through user 
						testing to see whether this application really has an impact on one's 
						food waste. 
						
						To summarize, we aimed to create an MVP application, using human-centered design, 
						which helps the users reduce their food waste. We achieved the first two, however, 
						whether this application actually works needs to be further evaluated through user
						 testing.</p>
